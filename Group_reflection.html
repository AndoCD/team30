    <h1>Group Work</h1>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>As a team we agree that we all worked well together.  We made very good use of MS Teams and when possible everyone joined as many meetings as possible which were set on Tuesdays and Thursdays at six thirty in the evening Melbourne local time. If someone was not able to join the meeting, they were still able to be kept up to date by watching recordings of the meetings at a later point in time. All sections of the assignment were assigned early and without problems. The point that we need to improve on for the next assignment is everyone’s input to the group’s GitHub repository, which does not come as a surprise to us. For a few of us, we may need to spend some time before beginning the next assignment by going over some tutorials so that we are comfortable with completing the basic functions in GitHub. </p>
    <p>In assignment two though, we all found working with MS Teams to be an efficient way of communicating and collecting the content required for our group website. A document with the heading of ‘Team30-MS’ in MS Teams clearly identifies which sections each person worked on. The first table under the title ‘Responsibilities’ shows this in more detail. This document also, was primarily used to document who was able to take part in particular meetings and what was discussed and decided upon. So unfortunately the group repository in GitHub should not be used to gain an overview of who did what for the assignment. However, the document in MS Teams has continually been updated as progress was made and shows this information.  </p>
    <p>For the next assignment we plan to continue to work on our communication and setting and sticking to deadlines that we set ourselves for when our work or progress is due. As a team we have already discussed some ideas for the next assignment on how to proceed and are excited to continue the good teamwork. </p>

    <h2>Meetings</h2>
    <p>MS Teams was the only tool that we used to communicate with each other.  We agreed to hold two meetings per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We conducted an interview in place of our group discussion on the 8th of Oct 2020 but followed up on the 9th of Oct with a group discussion as a replacement.</p>
