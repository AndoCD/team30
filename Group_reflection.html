    <h1>Group Work</h1>
    <h2>Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Yury</h3>
    <p>As a team we worked exceptionally well. Regular team meetings helped us stay on track and understand everyone's strengths, knowledge and interests better that we then leveraged when assigning tasks. I was surprised by the fact of how quickly we were able to get a start on things and work as a team having previously never met or worked before. Everyone showed great knowledge of collaborative online tools such as Zoom, MS Team and GitHub. The framework we decided to adapt is a team member would put their content on the MS Teams first and I will later push it to GitHub. This approach worked very well, however for our next assignment we can transition to team members contributing directly to GitHub. Working in a group environment helped me better understand what makes for a successful group project such as clear and regular communication, organisation of tasks, leveraging of expertise and skill, positive attitude, pro-active management of tasks to be done which were all displayed by Team 30. </p>

    <h3>Georgia</h3>
    <p>I believe our group worked very well together. From the beginning, we were all very quick and responsive to link together and select the two days and times for our weekly Microsoft Teams video calls. With the help from Jake taking charge of directing us through our meetings, everyone was able to share their ideas and opinions comfortably, which allowed us to collaborate very well.  </p>
    <p>I think there was little room for improvement for our team with this assignment, maybe a couple of small things like announcing personal deadlines for when each part of the project was going to be completed by. I had some work commitments that got in the way of me attending a few meetings and also delayed the overall completion of my parts of the assignment, which I hope didn't alarm anyone to think that I wasn't going to have my portions done on time.  </p>
    <p>One thing that surprised me was that each team member showed their strengths early on, some having prior experience in areas that could be beneficial for working on particular sections of the assignment. For example, Emma had a greater understanding of GitHub, and she took on the responsibility of creating a repository for the team and helped us all to establish how to update the versions correctly. Yury had the most experience in web development and immediately started working on the GitHub pages website presentation, which displays all of our written data in an appealing matter.  </p>
    <p>I've learned that as long as you have strong communication amongst your team members, it is possible to reach the goals you set for yourselves. Coming into this assignment as a group of people that had never met each other before, we all adapted to the situation at hand accordingly. We managed to finish our assignment together by staying on track and checking in with one another each week to make sure everyone was doing okay with the tasks allocated to them. </p>

    <h3>Leigh</h3>
    <p>The idea of group work didn’t thrill me at all however, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed it. I did get lucky – they are all good, we worked well together and everyone made a contribution.  </p>
    <p>Jake initiated the first meeting and documentation which was great. There are some challenges in group work with people you haven’t met before, particularly when the meetings are online instead of face to face. Technical issues arise but also you don’t get a read on body language so cues on when to speak can be hard to read. I personally have a tendency to try and fill silence but hope I don’t get in the way of others contributing. </p>
    <p>From a task allocation perspective everyone seemed to take on their tasks voluntarily, so there was no argy-bargy over who was doing what. I think that the project idea was the hardest part as the content itself needed to be collaborative and once we started digging into the detail of the technology, we had to keep asking ourselves about the scope of the solution.   </p>

    <h3>Jake</h3>
    <p>I found the experience of working as part of this group to be very positive. Everybody took responsibility for an equal workload in my opinion. The assignment seemed quite substantial to begin with but proved to be very manageable with all hands on deck. Everybody made it to more than 50% of the team meetings. There were no complaints or arguments amongst team members. Members were forward thinking and took initiative on different aspects of the assignment.  </p>
    <p>Although communication within the team meetings was exemplar, I believe there could be a small amount of improvement to be made in communication outside the team meetings e.g. early warning that we will be offline for an extended period of time (such as when I went away for a week without warning). </p>
    <p>There is a grid in the MS-Teams document that gives an indication of the work that each of us were assigned to. Although most of us have little to no Github activity log, we all put in a fair spread of work on the written component. I was surprised how well the team came together at the beginning and were able to get straight to work. We are each quite different but that certainly played in our favour.  </p>
    <p>I look forward to working alongside our team in the future! </p>

    <h3>Andrew</h3>
    <p>As a team I believe we worked very well together. Everyone was able to contribute to group discussions in our Microsoft Teams video meetings by presenting their own ideas. As we were discussing and working out who would work on specific sections, there was never any disgruntled emotions in the group as all topics where assigned with ease. Each of us were able to use our knowledge or skills to be able to complete a section, or multiple sections of the assignment. One thing that will need to be improved on for the next assignment is our individual input to the group repository on GitHub. As a group we discussed and agreed that the assignment content would be firstly uploaded onto a document on MS Teams, and from there Yury would transfer the information to the files on the GitHub repository.  It was actually surprising how well we all were able to work together considering we have never met each other or worked together before. By working in this team, it has confirmed that diversity in groups is actually an advantage. We all have different skills and abilities and by these different skills coming together meant that we were able to complete the assignment. </p>

    <h3>Emma</h3>
    <p>I have found that everyone in our team has contributed their fair share and we have all worked together well. Having regular meetings scheduled worked well as most of the group was able to attend each one. Dividing the assignment into sections also worked well as everyone was able to choose an area to work on that interested them. I believe the only improvement we could make is for each of us to make commits on GitHub in order to show our contributions. A personal improvement I need to make is to check teams more regularly and communicate my progress more often. What surprised me most about our team is how we fell into certain roles almost immediately and there have been no clashes about what needs to be done. Overall, our team worked together nicely, and we all made an equal contribution to the final product. </p>

    <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
    <p>As a team we agree that we all worked well together.  We made very good use of MS Teams and when possible everyone joined as many meetings as possible which were set on Tuesdays and Thursdays at six thirty in the evening Melbourne local time. If someone was not able to join the meeting, they were still able to be kept up to date by watching recordings of the meetings at a later point in time. All sections of the assignment were assigned early and without problems. The point that we need to improve on for the next assignment is everyone’s input to the group’s GitHub repository, which does not come as a surprise to us. For a few of us, we may need to spend some time before beginning the next assignment by going over some tutorials so that we are comfortable with completing the basic functions in GitHub. </p>
    <p>In assignment two though, we all found working with MS Teams to be an efficient way of communicating and collecting the content required for our group website. A document with the heading of ‘Team30-MS’ in MS Teams clearly identifies which sections each person worked on. The first table under the title ‘Responsibilities’ shows this in more detail. This document also, was primarily used to document who was able to take part in particular meetings and what was discussed and decided upon. So unfortunately the group repository in GitHub should not be used to gain an overview of who did what for the assignment. However, the document in MS Teams has continually been updated as progress was made and shows this information.  </p>
    <p>For the next assignment we plan to continue to work on our communication and setting and sticking to deadlines that we set ourselves for when our work or progress is due. As a team we have already discussed some ideas for the next assignment on how to proceed and are excited to continue the good teamwork. </p>

    <h2>Meetings</h2>
    <p>MS Teams was the only tool that we used to communicate with each other.  We agreed to hold two meetings per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We conducted an interview in place of our group discussion on the 8th of Oct 2020 but followed up on the 9th of Oct with a group discussion as a replacement.</p>
