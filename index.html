      <p>Upon thorough investigation into many job advertisements within our team, each member has indicated which ideal career they feel aligns closely with their interests. The roles mentioned in our personal profiles include Virtual/Augmented Reality Programming, Games Development, IT Project Management and Web Development and Design. Though each career can be perceived as vastly different from one another, they can all be considered a pathway that belongs to the IT and computing industry.
</p>
      <p>Some similarities would include programming and development, three of the career paths chosen amongst our team implements both of these tasks heavily. These elements are essential and are required to start from an empty canvas and allow construction of a foundation for any website, game, or virtual/augmented reality to function appropriately. Project managers would also generally need to have some idea of the programming languages so they can adjust or suggest further ideas to their team of staff.  Project management is needed across the board for all jobs mentioned, as it is very important to ensure tasks get distributed amongst the right people, there is management of team collaboration, and projects are getting completed on schedule for the group.  </p>
      <p>Differences that set the team members career paths apart would be that the outcome of each career is quite different. Though some share similarities within the main objective of programming and development, the finer applications, coding languages and tools used to create the final product for games vs realities and webpages are quite different as they are building completely different ideas. Project management is also a different role entirely by being a leadership role within a team. When put together each member could be the start to making a strong group of people who would be able to create products for a large audience.  </p>
      <p>Majority of our team has already tested the waters in either some sort of IT tool or program, some even have some experience within an IT job in general. All members of Team 30 have joined together by sharing a common goal of completing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. Allowing us all to gain a better understanding of what steps are necessary to take when approaching a career and practicing our own relevant proper research and experience techniques in this industry, therefore setting ourselves up for a passageway to success.
