      <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <h2>Remote Guided Maintenance</h2>
      <h3>Does your organisation own a large fleet of vehicles that operate throughout Australia?    </h3>
      </h3>Do you want to save thousands of dollars in call-out fees when your vehicles break down?   </h3>

      <h2>Overview </h2>
      <p>I would like to develop an application that can be installed onto the Microsoft HoloLens II (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwOnHqiNAeU) or other Augmented Reality (AR) platform. The application will give vehicle drivers access to all the important information necessary to maintain their vehicle, including vehicle specifications, operating instructions, troubleshooting and diagnosis guides. The technology will also function as a live video transmitter between the driver and a remote mechanic. The device with this application will save drivers hours of time waiting on the side of the road for a mechanic and will save the fleet owners thousands in break down call-out fees imposed by mobile mechanics.   </p>
      <h2>Context </h2>

      <p>Transport and the movement of goods cease when trucks and buses break down. Often companies must send technicians out from a workshop to diagnose, fix and/or recover broken-down vehicles. Alternatively, companies pay large call-out fees to contracted mobile mechanics. The technicians who deploy to support breakdowns are often going in blind, having only received vague fault descriptions in a work request email or over the phone. As a result, Technicians may take the incorrect tools and parts for the job or they may be driving out to do a repair that cannot be achieved on the side of the road. Sometimes the fix is simple and could be achieved by the driver. Sometimes the breakdown has occurred because the driver did not fully understand the operation of the vehicle or the daily maintenance requirements and fluid specifications of the vehicle.   </p>
      <p>The Remote Guided Maintenance (RGM) concept seeks to address all these issues by a providing each vehicle of an organisation with a wearable Augmented Reality device. The device would be installed with a practical application tailored to the make and model of the vehicle it belongs in.    </p>


      <h2>Outcome </h2>
      <p>The RGM concept has largely been tailored to large fleet owning organisation but could just as easily be adapted to suit everyday people. Nobody likes waiting on the side of the road for the mobile mechanic to arrive, especially when he says, “sorry there’s nothing I can do with your car on the side of the road”. This concept would save people paying roadside assistance fees, it would increase people’s awareness about their own vehicle, and it would result in vehicles lasting for much longer. When it comes to large organisations, a HoloLens is worth about $5599, most trucks today are worth in excess of $100 000, it would make sense that they pay a small amount extra for this device that will pay dividends in the long run.   </p>
