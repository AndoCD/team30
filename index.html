      <p>Required group skill set summary: in the requirements set by the chosen dream job advertisements, we can see that out of 200 identified IT specialized skills, the IT skills that this group required fall in the top 60. Structured Query Language (SQL) (rank 1), and Microsoft Windows (rank 4), building relationships (rank 6), are the top three IT specialised skills that have not been directly identified in our groups required skill set. Even though they are not explicitly mentioned, they would definitely still be needed in many of our roles. The top three baseline skills that were not mentioned directly in our groups skill set are writing (rank 4), troubleshooting (rank 6), and planning (rank 7). These three skills alone are definitely required for the IT Project Management roles. Without those three skills, it would not be possible to be an effective and successful IT Project Manager.

Version control and java knowledge are two IT specialised skills that will be used by all members of this group in their selected roles. Just as communication and problem solving are two baseline skills that are needed by everyone regardless of what industry they work in.  </p>
