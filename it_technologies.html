      <h1>IT Technologies</h1>
      <h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
      <h3>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now?  </h3>
      <p>Firstly it is important to understand what autonomous means in this context.  People often use “driverless”, “autonomous” and “self-driving” as interchangeable. However there is a big difference in the technology required for an “autonomous” vehicle that can only handle highways, and a truly “driverless” or “self-driving” car that doesn’t even need a steering wheel or human driver to park or navigate (Hicks, M & Fitzsimmons 2019).

        It seems that all the major tech and ride-share companies including Apple, Google and Uber along with all vehicle manufacturers are working hard on Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology. AV’s have already been in long trials globally and while we will slowly see them rolled out in limited environments, claims that fully autonomous road vehicles are coming any day now appear overstated. Aside from the technical challenges, their introduction faces legal and ethical hurdles.

        For example, while the Tesla Model 3 has an “Autopilot” feature that “enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane” (Tesla, 2020) there is still a need for a driver to be on standby in case something goes wrong – though the Tesla website claims that the driver is just there for legal reasons. What these cars can do is pretty enticing though, including autopark (where you can just jump out on the street and it goes off somewhere to find a spot and park itself), auto lane change and you can even summon your car to come to you.

        There is an agreed scale to describe levels of driving automation (Shuttleworth, J 2019): </p>

        <img src="images/j3016.jpg" alt="">

        <p>In terms of cars it is suggested that we are currently still at level 2, or partial automation.

          In Australia, BHP had a fleet of fully automated haul trucks in 2017 (Australian Mine Safety Journal, 2019). While these kinds of vehicles and applications are very impressive, they are essentially on fixed routes and don’t have to battle with the same kinds of variables that will challenge the rollout of driverless vehicles on public roads. Plus, there is a level of remote oversight with operator tracking from a control room. Nevertheless, they can still crash, as happened in March 2019 at the Jimblebar mine site. It was claimed that this was due to wet weather (Williams, P 2019).

          In Australia and around the world, limited trials of autonomous shuttle buses on fixed routes off the public road network are in operation but getting on to the public road without at least the oversight of a human operator is very rare.  </p>

          <h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>

          <p>Statements from vehicle manufacturers are particularly optimistic and it is not always easy to tell if this is just market spin. Elon Musk for example claims that fully autonomous cars will be here by the end of this year – 2020 (McDermid, J 2020).

            While automation is gradually becoming more refined, a full leap to fully driverless cars is a very difficult thing to put a timeline on and there will likely be constraints on where they can go - for example, dirt roads with no line markings.

            Some of the biggest challenges with AV’s are:

            Sensors – AV’s need to see the world around them and detect pedestrians, objects including other vehicles, the road itself, and signs. Camera’s let the car see objects. Lidar uses lasers to measure the distance to objects and radar detects objects and tracks them. Data is sent back to the vehicle’s control system to help it make decisions such as when to steer or brake. A fully autonomous car needs to handle a myriad of challenges and operate under all conditions – as you would expect, poor weather, vandalised road signs and paint spilled on the road will negatively impact the accuracy of sensing capability. </p>

            <p>Machine Learning – AI and machine learning will be key to AV’s using data from sensors to help it make correct decisions. Still relatively in its infancy, machine learning and deep learning will no doubt expand but while Elon Musk makes this sound just around the corner, others are concerned that machines “don’t have the flexibility of humans when facing a novel situation not included in their training data” (Dickson, B 2020). </p>

            <p>Regulation – As we have seen in many new advancing technologies, regulation has a tendency to lag behind innovation. In Australia, the Transforming Mobility report produced in joint by the NRMA, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Kelios Downer identified more than fifty federal, state and territory laws that would need to be amended due to references made to the “driver” where legislation assumes the driver would be a human (NRMA, 2020). </p>

            <p>Consideration around who would be responsible for things like infringements or accident compensation also need to be resolved. Fortunately in Australia we don’t have international land borders, so issues of jurisdiction won’t apply in the same way that would affect European travellers for example. </p>

            <p>Social acceptability – much has been made already of the value dilemma’s that may face autonomous vehicles – such as should a driverless car jeopardise its passenger’s safety to save someone else’s life?  No doubt there will be incidents that occur that will bring media scrutiny to AV crashes.  </p>

            <p>The World Health Organization reported that globally 1.35 million people were killed in road traffic accidents in 2016 and this number is growing (WHO, 2018). One would expect that demonstrated improvements in the road toll would make the technology more palatable to the public, but this may take some time. On the other hand, the idea of reading a book or getting home safely after a few drinks does hold some appeal. ADVI (Australia & New Zealand Driverless Vehicle Initiative) research “found that 70% of Australians want a self-driving car able to take over when they feel tired or bored, and just under threequarters (73%) of Australians wanting autonomous vehicle to transport them when they feel physically or mentally unable to drive manually” (ADVI, 2020). </p>

            <h3>What is the likely impact?  </h3>
            <p>Impacts will vary as technology evolves and there will no doubt be unforeseen positives and negatives. There are concerns now that driverless technology has the potential to put a massive number of people out of work – taxi and ride-share drivers, truck drivers - pretty much anyone who drives a vehicle for work. While taxi driver numbers in Australia are hard to pin down, Uber claim there are 60,000 Uber drivers in Australia (Groenveld, L 2019). Truck drivers number over 200,000 (Job Outlook, 2020). On the flip side, truck driving is among Australia’s most dangerous jobs (Monash University, 2018). Importantly though, these kinds of driving roles are often filled by un-skilled workers or new immigrants, so their loss may have a big impact on those less able to easily transition. </p>

            <p>Improved safety is likely. Approximately 95% of accidents are said to be due to driver error and 1,200 Australians are killed or injured in road accidents each year with a $30 billion annual cost of road trauma to the Australian economy (KPMG, 2020). There is general agreement amongst Australian and international experts that 90% of all accidents could be eliminated through advanced driverless vehicle technology. If this does play out there could be major flow on effects to industries including the auto repair sector, medical (due to a reduction in injuries), insurance and the legal profession where car accident claims are a key focus for some lawyers (ADVI, 2020). </p>

            <p>Fully autonomous vehicles will also have a big impact on the way we commute. You could be more productive and work or study on the way to the office, or alternatively relax or sleep. For those who don’t drive, have a disability or medical condition, AV’s will offer new opportunities to get around.

              It is argued by some that a new mobility industry will be borne as lower prices may have a flow on effect to car ownership. If the input costs of a taxi ride no longer included the drivers wage, it seems reasonable to anticipate that fares would be reduced. Interestingly it is noted that you may not own every facet of a driverless car, given that the manufacturers own the software that runs it. In turn it may be illegal for an owner to modify vehicle programming or make a repair (Dia, 2015). </p>

            <p>There have also been claims that manufacturers could escape the sales cycle and offer a subscription model (Debord, M 2018). The phrase ‘mobility as a service’ has now been coined.

              To what extent vehicles are connected will determine the kind of growth in digital infrastructure that governments will need to commit. This includes sensor networks, roadside equipment such as smart traffic lights that can tell AVs when to stop or go, and high-quality digital mapping (KPMG, 2020). So we would expect to see some major infrastructure works rolled out over time as AV’s gain footing. </p>
              <p>In conclusion, there are a lot of different levels of automation, and certainly many features in current cars operate autonomously now – such as lane centering and automated cruise control. A truly driverless car will need to be capable of quite a lot to eliminate the need for human intervention. In the short term at least, higher levels of automation appear most likely in mining and heavy transport where platooning trucks has been talked about for some time (Jones, L 2019). However, whilst car manufacturers might have a tendency to simplify the challenges at least in public statements, there do still appear to be some major obstacles to pass before we have truly driverless vehicles dominating our roads. As has been the case with other disruptive technologies, there will be winners and losers. </p>

              <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
              <h3>What is the Cloud, what does it do now and where is it going? (600 Words)</h3>
              <p>Cloud computing is where a network of remotely situated servers is used to host and store a user’s data, which can then be accessed at any time on any machine via an internet browser or an online application.

                Cloud computing has been around for many years. The first instances of Cloud computing were in the 1960s when organisations could rent time on a mainframe. In 2006, Cloud computing gained popularity with Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3), online services that enable ‘compute’ in the Cloud and storage in the Cloud respectively. Nowadays, whether you know it or not, most of us use the Cloud – access to the same emails across multiple devices is a prime example of this.</p>

                <h3>There are three commonly used Cloud computing architectures: </h3>

                <ol>
                  <li>a. Public Clouds are a service, such as Microsoft Azure, which are made accessible to the public via public internet. The general public can access services such as virtual machines (discussed below), applications and storage, often paid but sometimes for free.  </li>
                  <li>b. Private Clouds are only accessible by one enterprise using a private network, and can take two forms, either a data centre located on site, or a data centre that is owned by another company.  </li>
                  <li>c. Hybrid Clouds join together public and private Clouds to give businesses more flexibility, accessibility, and security in deploying the Cloud.  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>All Clouds are data centres; the difference is where they are located and how they are accessed.</p>

                <h3>Data centres</h3>
                <p>A data centre is the physical location where critical IT infrastructure – such as routers, security devices, switches, servers, app delivery controllers and more – are stored. Some businesses continue to set up and manage their own data centres on premises, whilst others pay large organisations, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), to use their data centres with the Cloud. Data centres require an uninterrupted power supply, ventilation, cooling and other systems to keep them operational.  </p>

                <p>Let us look at some other features of Cloud computing that help us understand what is being and can be done with this exciting technology.  </p>
                <h3>IaaS, PaaS and SaaS</h3>
                <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) removes the need for an organisation to own and maintain their own data centre. Instead, as mentioned previously, businesses can rent remote data centres that are accessible via an online network. IaaS enables virtualisation and supports services such as networking, storage, computing and much more.</p>
                <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is an online (Cloud-based) platform, such as OpenShift and Google App Engine, that developers can use to create and host web applications. PaaS removes the need for developers to provision and manage a data centre, administer data bases, server configuration, sharding, load balancing, etc. Cloud enabled platforms allow applications to scale at a moment’s notice. Applications developed using PaaS become SaaS once they are complete.  </p>
                <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) refers to software that is delivered over the internet, usually for purchase or subscription, such as Dropbox. The Cloud based software remains under the management of the developer, who continues to facilitate the servers, manage data and update the application. The full utility of the software is then accessible on any computer from an internet browser – Dropbox, for example, provides users with storage and access to personal data from any device in any part of the world connected to the internet.</p>

                <img src="images/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-breakdown.jpg">

                <h3>Virtualisation</h3>

                <p>Virtualisation is the process of using software to compartmentalise the hardware of a PC or server to run one or more virtual machines (VMs). For virtualisation to occur, hypervisor software needs to first be installed above the physical server or PC (the host). The hypervisor is responsible for creating and supporting any number of VMs which are collectively called guest machines.  </p>
                <h3>There are two types of hypervisors (HVs):</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Type 1 hypervisors (such as MS Hyper-V) are installed directly on top of physical servers, and are the most popular solution for enterprises. They allow all members of an enterprise to access a personal virtual environment from any computer that is connected to the private network. Benefits include centralised updates, reduced latency and rapid scalability for enterprise.  </li>
                  <li>Type 2 or ‘hosted’ hypervisors are installed onto the OS of a machine. Type 2 hypervisors are separated from the server by the OS on which it is installed. The underlying OS manages calls from the VM to the Central Processing Units (CPU), memory, storage, etc. Hosted HVs are usually installed by individuals onto their computers and are used for testing software or using applications that require an older OS to function.  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What is the future of Cloud computing?  </h3>
                <p>The greatest advances of cloud computing in the short term are PaaS and SaaS. Increased accessibility to software and platforms via the internet browser reduces the need for end users to download and update software on their own machine, which can chew up bandwidth and be time consuming. “In 10-15 years, people won’t be talking about routers and individual networks, everything will be the network.” (Marcus Vlahovic n.d.).  </p>
                <h3>Edge computing  </h3>
                <p>Edge Computing is a modern way of decentralising data centres. Some of the tasks that have historically been the responsibility of centralised data centres – such as gathering, processing, analysing and storing data – are now being carried out on micro data centres. These are in physically closer proximity to the end user, reducing bandwidth requirements and improving latency. In 2019 an estimated 15 billion edge devices were in use, which is expected to increase to 150 billion by 2025. Enterprises will have millions of devices that need to be managed. Such exponential increases come with a whole host of security issues and diversity issues (different operating systems and hardware). “Hardware won’t be the problem in a decade – software will.” (Matt Riley n.d.)  </p>
                <h3>Quantum Computing as a Service  </h3>
                <p>Another exciting but comparatively distant Cloud enabled technology is Quantum-Computing as a Service. Quantum computing may be able to make calculations and simulate molecules in a way that classical computers cannot. With open source developer tools such as Qiskit, IBM has been leading the way in making Quantum computing accessible over the Cloud from virtually anywhere. </p>
                <h3>GPU (Graphics Processing Units) computing  </h3>
                <p>In a world where the IoT and AI are becoming more prolific, CPUs have been identified as physically limiting. GPU computing, in contrast, has already proven its effectiveness over CPUs in areas such as Bitcoin mining and deep learning. Looking ahead, users may have access to data centres full of GPUs over the Cloud</p>

                <h3>What does the Cloud mean for the world and jobs? (300 Words)  </h3>
                <p>Previously, most businesses would have to both purchase and store large amounts of IT infrastructure, with the associated expenditure for cooling, ventilation, backup power supplies, and office space.  For many businesses today, however, IT needs can be more conveniently and economically met through using IaaS, SaaS and PaaS. Storage and computational power requirements are scalable with just a few clicks. The Cloud reduces capital expenditure and can increase return on investment. Additionally, the Cloud has facilitated greater flexibility in the workplace, making it possible for teams to collaborate virtually – a particularly pertinent benefit in the world during COVID-19 – through applications such as Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365 </p>

                <p>The Cloud also represents a huge leap forward for public consumers. Services such as Netflix and Stan enable users to stream films from a Cloud server without needing to exhaust their own storage space. The popular gaming platform ‘Steam’ vastly improves the accessibility of gaming and offers many options for payment like ‘pay-per-play’, ‘crippled play for free’ and outright purchase.  </p>

                <h3>Emissions  </h3>
                <p>Reduced energy consumption because of Cloud computing has led to huge reductions in emissions and reduced electronic waste. The centralisation of data centres means that both virtual and physical resources can be utilised far more efficiently, compared with having many small data centres. Furthermore, large companies, such as Google and AWS, are beginning to utilise renewable energy to power their data centres. Yevgeniy Sverdlik (2016) noted that US data centres consumed about 70 billion kWh of electricity in 2014 – equivalent to the consumption of about 6.4 million American homes that year. It is predicted however that energy efficiency improvements between 2010 and 2020 will have saved 620 billion kWh. See this article on LinkedIn for more mind-boggling facts about the environmental impact of the internet: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/environmental-impact-internet-searches-data-centers-pranav-prakash/">link</a>   </p>
                <h3>Jobs  </h3>
                <p>There are some jobs that have come under threat, such as those centred around configuring and maintaining infrastructure. “[There will be fewer] enterprise job openings for server administrators, database administrators and infrastructure and network people,” (Ted Schadler, 2009). Those who do remain will shift their focus to the strategic use of technology for optimising IT processes in business. They will need to understand Cloud technology and business requirements well in order to coordinate contracts and develop strong relationships with service providers.  </p>
                <h3>Downfalls with the Cloud  </h3>
                <p>As with all services, there are pitfalls; the Cloud is no exception. For businesses that rely solely on VMs or the Cloud, operations would cease without an internet connection. Control is removed from the user, who must always rely on Cloud service providers to keep their IT infrastructure secure and operational. Inherent to internet use is a range of privacy and security risks, such as malware infection, eavesdropping and ‘man in the middle’ attacks. Bandwidth also continues to be a limiting factor in Cloud computing, particularly for gaming and video streaming.  </p>
                <h3>How does all this affect me? (300 Words)  </h3>
                <p>here is no doubt that if I embrace all the Cloud has to offer, now and into the future, my technological life will be greatly improved.

                  Opting for a computer tailored to Cloud based use, such as a Chromebook, has the immediate advantage of a reduced initial outlay – although Chromebooks are limited by the fact that there are still many applications that are not available as SaaS.

                  Through the Cloud, my access to all my services and data extends to most devices that I wish to use, and nearly worldwide. Universal access, however, is limited by regulations imposed by particular countries that prohibit some online services such as Gmail and Microsoft OneDrive.  </p>
                <p>The Cloud and virtualisation have facilitated flexible work arrangements – notably, the ability to work remotely or from home, the benefits of which were made extremely prevalent during COVID-19. This increased the quality of life for many people who might otherwise be expected to physically attend their workplace to enact their duties.

                  The Cloud is already blurring the lines between devices we are logged into. One day, everything in our own name will talk to the other, from our personal and workplace phones and computers, to our cars and household appliances. There is an incredibly interconnected world ahead. However, it is sobering to consider the access into our lives that hackers would have if they were to obtain our credentials. </p>
