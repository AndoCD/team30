    <p>Before we jump into summarizing each ideal job in the list, it is important to identify some important points about the information provided by Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies). Firstly, there are two skill lists. One that is ‘Data specialized’ skills, which lists IT specific skills in order of most sort after or most used, to least sort after or least used. Then there are also lists for ‘Data baseline’ skills, which is a list of skills that are not just used in the IT industry but any industry. These skills were taken from a data pool of 121,997 job advertisements in the time frame from 01st March 2017 to 28th February 2018. The job lists are also basically in two parts as there is a more broad list what states occupations, and another list which states actual job titles. The shown ranking of the ideal jobs above has been taken from the occupation list titled ‘Top Occupations Year March 2018’. </p>

    <p>Full Stack Web Developer : when we view the information collected under the ‘Top Burning Glass Occupations (BGTOCCs)’ data from March 2017 until February 2018, we see that the occupation of web developer is quite highly sort after coming in at around number six on the list out of twenty-five occupations. However, if we look specifically for ‘Full Stack Web Developer’, on the top IT Jobs list, we will find this job title further down around position seventeen. This is because to become a Full Stack Web Developer, one must first gain a vast amount of experience as a Front and Back End Developer, however as this job requires more experience and possibly seniority, the job is not as high in demand as front and back end web developers. </p>

    <p>From the above table it is clear that the majority of skills required to be successful in this position are definitely IT based skills. Being organized, being creative, and communicating are important, however based on the requirements from the selected job or position advertisement, the skills that are outlined and focused on, are many of the requirements in the top forty IT skills listed in the Burning Glass documents. The need for a clear understanding of how everything on the internet is built is very evident, and therefore requires a large amount of specific IT skills. An interesting video online (link below) on his YouTube channel from Gyasi Linje outlines many of the technical skills which are required to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and it is no surprise that the majority of the skills he mentions are ranked very highly on the Burning Glass Technologies IT specific skills lists. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eX1hl8AWXA&t=12s </p>

    <p>IT Project Manager: this position was not actually listed on any of the Burning Glass Technologies lists. However in some cases this job may fall under the umbrella of IT Manager which is ranked 10th on the occupations list. Another alternative for this job could be the title of ‘Implementation Consultant’, which has a very similar job description. The job title of ‘implementation consultant’ was number 140 on the Burning Glass Technologies list. It can therefore be determined that this position is not as in demand as it is much further down the list.</p>

    <p>For this position baseline skills seem to be just as important if not more important than IT specialised skills. Some IT specialised skills that ranked very high with this position are ones such as Java which came in at number three, and version control such as Git which was number nineteen in the specialised skills list. Other skills that have been identified as vital in this position are managerial or leadership skills, organizational skills, communication skills, budgeting skills, and even foreign languages which make up a large part of the last quarter of the Burning Glass baseline skills list. However the most important fact to note is that the top three baseline skills are required for this job, which means that people that are organized, able to lead, and can communicate effectively, will be the ones well suited to this job.</p>

    <p>VR / AR Programmer: this job title was not listed specifically in the Burning Glass Technologies jobs list. However the job could fall under the position of Multimedia Designer / Animator which was ranked 19th. For this position as a Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) Programmer, a keen interest in or background in gaming gives you an advantage as you already have experience in interacting with this digital world. According to Dinesh Punni (who has over four years of experience in VR), people wanting to be a VR / AR programmer, should learn or have experience with the development engines Unity or Unreal. For people that use Unity, they will also have to know the programming language C# (rank 6), and for those using Unreal, they will have to use C++ (rank 27)as those programs pair together. Java knowledge may be one of the most useful skills however in this role as it is ranked as number four behind Structured Query Language (SQL) at number one, and JavaScript at number two , and Microsoft Windows at number three, all of which are also vital to have knowledge of in this role.  One video on Dinesh’s YouTube channel about becoming a VR developer can be viewed by clicking on the following link:

    <p>Web Developer: this position is quite sort after and made it to sixth place on the occupations list, and fifteenth place on the Burning Glass Technologies most sort after IT jobs. For this position IT specific skills and generic skills need to combine to make a great web developer. Using highly in demand knowledge, experience and skills such as HTML (rank fourteen), CSS (rank twenty-seven), version control (rank 19). These skills need to be used alongside baseline skills required in this position such as creativity (rank nine on the Burning Glass generic skills list), communication (rank one), and problem solving skills (rank two).

Looking more closely at the role of a front end developer, this job ranked in at number six on the list which was created using advertisements from a total of 5,990 jobs being on offer from 01st March 2017 until 28th February 2018. This confirms that jobs that are based around web development are amongst the jobs in highest demand.  </p>

    <p>Mid-to-Senior Unity Developer: this position was also not listed however because of the technical similarities it could also fall under the occupation titled Multimedia Designer / Animator which as stated before, was listed as number 19. As this technology grows though, this job could become more and more in demand. Also as stated before, people that use Unity, will also have to know the programming language C# (rank 6), and for those using Unreal, they will have to use C++ (rank 27), as those programs work together. If someone already has knowledge of Java, then learning Unity will be easier as apparently the programming language Java, is similar to C#. Java ranked fourth on the list of IT specialized skills, therefore it is very important and sort after by many employers. The other main IT specific skill required is the ability to use a version control platform such ag Git (rank 19).

As far as baseline skills go, problem solving skills (rank 2) is highlighted as one of the most important skills needed for this position.  </p>

    <p>Required group skill set: here we will outline this groups skills required based on the ideal jobs and the skills identified in the job advertisements. </p>
